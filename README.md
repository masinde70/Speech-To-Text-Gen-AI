Retrieval Augmented Generation on audio data with LangChain and Chroma database 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows you to add relevant documents as context when querying LLMs.

RAG on audio data using LangChain and Chroma 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method to augment the relevance and transparency of Large Language Model (LLM) responses. In this approach, the LLM query retrieves relevant documents from a database and passes these into the LLM as additional context. RAG therefore helps improve the relevancy of responses by including pertinent information in the context, and also improves transparency by letting the LLM reference and cite source documents.
